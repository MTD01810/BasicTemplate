**It's time to get to work on 2020! **

Join me for a house party, where we'll be writing letters to unregistered voters in critical states, to provide registration links and instructions. The letters are pre-printed; you just add a short note.

Think about it: if you help register a voter in one of our targeted Super States, that voter can help us win a key Senate seat, a Presidential swing state, and key State House and Senate races necessary to roll back gerrymanders.

RSVP here, and be sure to invite your friends too. It's all about maximizing the impact of your time and money. I hope to see you soon.

Judy

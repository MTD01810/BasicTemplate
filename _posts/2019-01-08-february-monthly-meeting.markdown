**Please note**: We originally planned to hold our March meeting on Tue March 26th, but that conflicted with the local election. So we moved it to the Thursday *before* the election. 

**First hour - Guest Speakers**
* David Kronman - Will review the results of our 2019 prioritization survey, with a particular focus on the ranked choice voting process that was used to determine the results.
* A representative from Voter Choice - To discuss the current Ranked Choice Voting legislation that is being considered here on Beacon Hill. 

**Second hour - Action**<BR>
We will break out in to working groups for the five top issues we will focus on in 2019. 
* [Progressive Leadership](https://bit.ly/2tXd1Qt)
* [Environment](https://bit.ly/2F0gnZg)
* [Healthcare](https://bit.ly/2TF0zD9)
* [Civic Engagement](https://bit.ly/2NTrKVA)
* [Election Integrity](https://bit.ly/2F29RBa)

**All are welcome - hope to see you there!**

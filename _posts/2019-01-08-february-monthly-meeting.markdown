Please join us for a Meet the Candidates forum before the local election (on March 26). We will invite Select Board and School Committee candidates to come make a case for their candidacy. There will be time for mingling and 1:1 conversations with the candidates. 

Select Board candidates: 
- [Dan Koh](http://teamkoh.com/)

School Committee candidates: 
- Shannon Scully
- [Paul Murphy](https://www.murphyforandover.org/)

We will also have sitting Select Board members Annie Gilbert and Laura Gregory at the meeting, as well as sitting School Committee members Susan McCready and Joel Blumstein.

(As confirmations come in we will continue to add names to the agenda.)

Hope to see you there!

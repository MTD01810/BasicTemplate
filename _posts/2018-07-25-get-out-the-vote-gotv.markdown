Canvassing for the Environmental Voter Project is a simple process. You will have designated names/addresses of people who have documented concern about the environment but do not vote regularly. You will have canvassing reporting sheets and “commitment to vote” brochures. But you will be asking only for a commitment to vote in the midterm elections, not to vote for any particular person.

Are you, like many of us, hesitant to canvass? 

If the answer is yes, this piece by Marcia Hohn, a member of our GOTV team, may help you get involved:

### WHY I LIKE TO CANVASS 
**by Marcia Drew Hohn**

I was very apprehensive about canvassing when I started with Obama’s New Hampshire campaign in 2008 and continued for Hillary in 2016. Here is what I found to like about canvassing:

* Most people are receptive to being asked questions and are very aware of the high stakes in our elections over the past 10 years and even more so now. I rarely had anyone be rude or angry even if they expressed different political convictions.

* It was fun to talk with people. I wasn’t trying to convert them. I was only asking them to consider a particular candidate or issue and/or commit to voting.

* It gave me a gut level feel for how it was going for a candidate, issue, or interest in voting. During the NH 2008 campaign, I could feel the momentum shifting to Obama. In contrast, during the 2016 campaign (also NH) I could feel the lack of enthusiasm for Hillary, and I got the sense that left leaning voters were more anti-Trump than pro-Hillary.

* I got to walk and learn about the variable economic and social atmospheres of the neighborhoods, which was starker in NH but is still very present here in Andover.

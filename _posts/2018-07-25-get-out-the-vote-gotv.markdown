**Are you interested in getting more voters to the polls?**

If so, please join us as we canvass intermittent voters using the [Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/)'s get out the vote strategy. To sign up, go to our [EVP event posting](https://www.facebook.com/events/802896223251104/).

**Why do we love this strategy?**

* It's simple. EVP uses sophisticated methods to identify progressive environmentalists with inconsistent voting records. All we have to do is ask those people to vote.

* EVP's strategy results in a significant increase in voter turnout (up to 13% or more) by environmentalists in the targeted community.

* EVP's strategy focuses on voters who are typically not targeted by political candidates. Candidates like to use their limited resources to target "super voters" -- people who vote regularly. EVP targets "intermittent" voters -- people with inconsistent voting records -- so there is no overlap.

Canvassing for the Environmental Voter Project is a simple process. You will have designated names/addresses of people who have documented concern about the environment but do not vote regularly. You will have canvassing reporting sheets and “commitment to vote” brochures. But you will be asking only for a commitment to vote in the midterm elections, not to vote for any particular person.

**Are you, like many of us, hesitant to canvass?**

If the answer is yes, this piece by Marcia Hohn, a member of our GOTV team, may help you get involved:

We will be using this meeting to kickoff our 2018 efforts, so let's have an all-hands-on deck attendance. This year will be primarily focused on elections and voter engagement, with prioritization on our home turf. 

Since Andover's local elections for Board of Selectmen and School Committee are on March 27 (four weeks away!), that will be the focus of February's meeting.

**Agenda**
* 6:30 - 7:00 - Socialize, network, meet your fellow resistors
* 7:00 - 7:30 - 2018 Kickoff aka Operation Big Blue Wave - Mission overview and teams
* 7:30 - 8:30 - Guest speakers - TBD

We will be in the "Meeting Room". Enter the building in the right of the courtyard through the door that says "Children's Center". We are up the stairs and to the right. 

We are allowed to bring food & drink - we are all mad enough, no need to be hangry too. And all are welcome - spouses, kids, and even a moderate republican. 

Hope to see you there! #resist #persist

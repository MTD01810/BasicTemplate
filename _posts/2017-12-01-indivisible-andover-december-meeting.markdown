Our focus this year will be on getting as many Dems elected as possible - at the local, state, and federal levels; on our home turf and in sister districts all over the country. The local Andover town election is only five weeks away, so that will be our primary objective for now.

February Meeting Theme - Local Elections and Get out the Vote
 
Meet the Candidates 
* Annie Gilbert - Board of Selectmen candidate
* Chris Huntress - Board of Selectmen candidate
* [Reaching out to other candidates ... stay tuned]

Agenda
* Indivisible Andover - Mission Overview
* GOTV Update - Plan of Attack and Progress
* Candidate presentations - Includes an opportunity to provide **feedback **on their message, ask **questions**, and **volunteer **to support their campaigns.

As usual, we will be in the "Meeting Room". Enter the building in the right of the courtyard through the door that says "Children's Center". We are up the stairs and to the right. 

We are allowed to bring food & drink (we are mad enough, no need to be hangry too). And all are welcome - spouses, kids, and even a moderate republican. 

Hope to see you there! #resist #persist

Please join us the Tuesday before Christmas to keep the momentum up. Lots to report on. 

**Agenda**
* 6:30 - 7:00 - Socialize, network, meet your fellow resistors
* 7:00 - 7:30 - Update since Nov meeting
* 7:30 - 8:30 - Guest speaker - Peter Polga-Hecimovich of the Environmental Voter Project 

We are allowed to bring food & drink, so let's bring festive treats (liquid and not) to celebrate the winter solstice and holidays. The first 30 minutes of the meeting are for socializing, or for reenacting the final scene of "It's a Wonderful Life" ... your call. 

We will be in the "Meeting Room" . Enter the building in the right of the courtyard through the door that says "Children's Center". We are up the stairs and to the right. 

I look forward to seeing everyone there!

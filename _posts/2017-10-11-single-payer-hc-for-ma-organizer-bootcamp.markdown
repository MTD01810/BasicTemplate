Harvard Medicine Indivisible is a part of the [Right to Health MA Coalition](https://www.righttohealthma.org/). We are invited to two upcoming coalition events. The first is:

Right to Health MA Organizer Bootcamp <BR>
Saturday, 10/14, 9am-4pm <BR>
Minuteman High School <BR>
758 Marrett Road, Lexington, MA <BR>


The Organizer Bootcamp will bring together organizers, activists, and concerned citizens to kick off our drive to build a grassroots movement for single payer healthcare in Massachusetts. This day-long event will train attendees in effective techniques for community organizing and legislative advocacy around single payer. Speakers will include State Senator Jamie Eldridge, State Representative Mike Connolly, and MassCare Executive Director Ture Turnbull. RSVP for the Bootcamp soon as spots are filling quickly!   

The Bootcamp is in preparation for our second event, a lobby day at the Statehouse on November 14th, where we hope to turn out 1000 activists. 

Right to Health MA Lobby Day <BR>
Tuesday, 11/14, 10am-12pm <BR>
MA State House <BR>
24 Beacon St, Boston, MA 02133 <BR>

Hope to see you at one or both events! Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you'd like to get involved with the coalition's work.

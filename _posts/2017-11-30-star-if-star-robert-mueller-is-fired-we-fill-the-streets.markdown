**Our house is on fire — let’s act like it.**

This September, millions of us will walk out of our workplaces and homes to join young climate strikers on the streets and demand an end to the age of fossil fuels. We demand climate justice for everyone.

**Please note:** This event is meant to be a youth-led, student walk-out that takes place during the day on Friday. Please contact your school or office to see if there is an event you can join on Friday.
 
Greater Andover Indivisible is adding our support to the [Global Climate Strike](https://globalclimatestrike.net/) during our regular **Saturday **morning demonstration (combined with the 'We the People' solidarity march).

Please bring your own signs, but we will also have some sign-making materials available for people who need them.

**Why phone bank?**
* Second only to canvassing, phone banking gets results.
* Canvassing is not an option in 2020
* 60 – 85% of people reached, or who get our voice message, turnout to vote
* So phone banking is really, really important.

We know that many people dislike, even fear, the very idea of calling strangers. And we get it.  Really. Because we’ve been there. We’ve tried it, survived, and even enjoyed it.

**Join Us for "A Taste of Phone Banking" for New & Experienced Callers**
* **Every Wednesday, starting August 26th** we are offering “A Taste of Phonebanking.” 
* You sign up [HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisiblegreaterandover/event/302734/), we provide training, and you make 15 easy phone calls.
That’s it, you’re done in an hour, UNLESS, you decide it’s not so bad, or even that you kind of like it, and want to stay longer.
* Experienced phonebankers can skip the training portion and jump right into making calls. 
* Also available: a personalized mini-phonebank. Contact us at indivisible.andover@gmail.com to sign up by yourself or bring an equally hesitant friend or neighbor.

**Why phone bank?**
* Second only to canvassing, phone banking gets results.
* Canvassing is not an option in 2020
* So phone banking is really, really important.

We know that many people dislike, even fear, the very idea of calling strangers. And we get it.  Really. Because we’ve been there.

**Join Us for "A Taste of Phone Banking"** <BR>
* On **Wednesday, August 12** we are offering “A Taste of Phonebanking.” 
* You sign up, we provide training, and you make 10 measly phone calls.
That’s it, you’re done in an hour, UNLESS, you decide it’s not so bad, or even that you kind of like it, and want to stay longer.
* Also available: a personalized mini-phonebank. The training part will be faster than with multiple people, so you could be done with your 10 calls in 45 minutes. Sign up by yourself or bring an equally hesitant friend or neighbor.

If interested in any of the above, please email us at indivisible.andover@gmail.com.

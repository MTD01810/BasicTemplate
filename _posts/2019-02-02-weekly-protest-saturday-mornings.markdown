Please come join us on the corner of routes 133 and 28 in Andover, Shawsheen corner right near Brickstone plaza. 

We will be there every **Saturday morning from 10:00-11:00 am**. 

So far we have protested:
* The separation of immigrant families at the border
* The need for better gun control (part of March for Our Lives)
* The protection of the Russia investigation
* "Moderate" Charlie Baker helping conservative Jim Lyons raise money
* Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court
* General protesting against Trump

We also demonstrate: 
* On behalf of candidates we support
* To encourage people to register to vote
* To remind people about when to vote - local election, primary, and now Nov 6th

Please bring signs, warm layers and friends. All are welcome - even dogs!

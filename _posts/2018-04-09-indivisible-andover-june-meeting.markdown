Our focus this year will be on getting as many progressive candidates elected as possible - at the local, state, and federal levels; on our home turf and in sister districts all over the country.

Please come meet the candidates and learn about our get out the vote plans at our next meeting, Tuesday, June 26th. (Check out the [coverage of our last meeting](https://bit.ly/2tbZ93J) in the local paper, The Andover Townsman.)

**Guest Speakers**
* [Lori Trahan](https://loritrahan.com/) - Candidate for MA-03 Congressional seat
* [Barbara L'Italien](http://teambarbara.com/) - Candidate for MA-03 Congressional seat
* The GOTV working group has invited a speaker from the [Environmental Voter Project (EVP)](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/our-mission) to give us an overview of how we can use their tools and training to get out the vote. They make it as easy as possible and the difference it makes is impressive. We know how important voter turnout is based on the local election results, so come learn about ways you can make an impact on this front for the midterms.

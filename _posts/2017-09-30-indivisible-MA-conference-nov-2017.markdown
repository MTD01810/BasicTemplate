Coming one year after the disastrous election of 2016 and one year before the critical midterm election of 2018, this 2nd statewide conference is focused on skills training, getting ready for the 2018 elections now, and how Massachusetts can counteract the negative effects of the Trump agenda. There will be training and critical workshops to give groups the tools they need to up their activism game and to connect with other groups for more coordinated action post-conference.

Preparations are actively underway, and we’ll keep you updated as the details become final. For now, we hope you’ll extend a SAVE THE DATE invitation for Sunday, November 12th to your group to come learn, meet your fellow Indivisibles in the state, and build new networks.

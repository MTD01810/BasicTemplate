One of our biggest successes prior to the midterms was driving voter turnout. We will continue efforts on this front, locally and out-of-district, in order to maximize voter engagement and work towards better representation in our elected officials. 

“We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.” - Thomas Jefferson

Your vote is your voice. Here's how to make sure you are heard:
1. Make sure you are registered to vote. [Check your registration status here](https://bit.ly/1IYJYjQ).
2. Look to see if you are going to be in town on the day of a given election. If not, request an absentee ballot by the deadline. ([Absentee voting details for Andover, MA](https://bit.ly/2I5r4cy))
3. Ask your friends and family if they are registered to vote. Repeat steps 1 and 2. 

**Why this is important**
* You can't assume you are registered. 
* Voter rolls are being purged as a means of voter suppression.

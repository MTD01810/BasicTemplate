### “We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.” <BR>- Thomas Jefferson

**Why this is important**
* You can't assume you are registered. 
* Voter rolls are being purged as a means of voter suppression. 
* More information: "[Voter purges are on the rise in states with a history of racial discrimination](https://bit.ly/2O48XXq)" (Vox, July 2018) 

**How to make sure your voice is heard**
1. Make sure you are registered to vote. [Check your registration status here](https://bit.ly/1IYJYjQ).
2. Look to see if you are going to be in town on the day of a given election. If not, request an absentee ballot by the deadline. ([Absentee voting details for Andover, MA](https://bit.ly/2I5r4cy))
3. Ask your friends and family if they are registered to vote. Repeat steps 1 and 2.

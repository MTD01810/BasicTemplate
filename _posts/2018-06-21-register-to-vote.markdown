One of our biggest efforts between now and the midterms will be to drive voter turnout. Make sure you are able to do your part by making your vote count:
1. Make sure you are registered to vote in time. [Check your registration status here](https://bit.ly/1IYJYjQ).
2. Look to see if you are going to be in town on the day of both the primary and the election. If not, request an absentee ballot by the deadline. ([Absentee voting details for Andover, MA](https://bit.ly/2I5r4cy))
3. Ask your friends and family if they are registered to vote. Repeat steps 1 and 2. 

**Why this is important**
You can't assume you are registered. Voter rolls are being purged as a means of voter suppression. More information: "[Voter purges are on the rise in states with a history of racial discrimination](https://bit.ly/2O48XXq)" (Vox, July 2018) Take control of your constitutional right.

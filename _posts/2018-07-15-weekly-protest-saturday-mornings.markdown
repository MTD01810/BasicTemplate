Please come join us on the corner of routes 133 and 28 in Andover, Shawsheen corner right near Brickstone plaza. 

We will be there every **Saturday morning from 10:00-11:00 am**. 

So far we have protested:
* The separation of immigrant families at the border
* The need for better gun control (part of March for Our Lives)
* The protection of the Russia investigation
* "Moderate" Charlie Baker helping conservative Jim Lyons raise money
* Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court
* General protesting against Trump

We also demonstrate on behalf of candidates we support and include messages that remind people to register and vote. 

Please bring a sign, warm layers and friends. All are welcome - even dogs!

**Do one thing a day, every day. ACT or DONATE**

Remember how you felt the morning after the presidential election in 2016? Sick. And an overwhelming feeling that you should have done more. 

Don't repeat that experience this November, the morning after the midterms. Each week between now and the midterms we will send out a weekly schedule of ways for you to contribute to the blue wave in less than an hour each day. Not available for our event? Pick your own. No time for anything? Contribute $5 to a worthy blue wave cause of your choice.

One hour or $5 every day for 37 days. So when you wake up on Nov 7th, whether we're floating on a blue wave or not, you can honestly say you did everything you could.

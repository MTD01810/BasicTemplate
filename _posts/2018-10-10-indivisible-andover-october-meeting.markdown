Come join us at our last meeting before the midterms for an overview of the three ballot questions voters will have to decide on, as well as activism opportunities in the final push to election day. 

**Ballot Question 1** - Regulation of nurse to patient ratios
* A "yes" vote would limit how many patients can be assigned to each nurse in hospitals and other health care facilities across the state.
* We will have guest speakers for both a 'Yes' and 'No' vote, because this one is clear as mud. 

**Ballot Question 2** - Money in politics, election spending
* A "yes" vote would allow the creation of a commission to consider amendments to the US Constitution "to establish that corporations do not have the same Constitutional rights as human beings and that campaign contributions and expenditures may be regulated," according to a summary from Galvin's office.
* We will have a guest speaker for a 'Yes' vote

**Ballot Question 3** - Transgender rights
* A "yes" vote on this referendum keeps in place a law, passed in 2016 and signed by Gov. Charlie Baker. The law prohibits discrimination of gender identity in places of public accommodation, like retail stores. A "no" vote would repeal the law.
* We will have a guest speaker for a 'Yes' vote

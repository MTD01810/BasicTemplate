Same bat time, same bat channel, but new night of the week! Please join us the Sunday before Thanksgiving to keep the momentum up. Lots to report on. 

Agenda - Looking to confirm with a couple of guest speakers - one from the Environmental Voter Project and someone from Indivisble Westford to speak about the carbon tax being proposed in MA. 

6:30 - 7:00 - Socialize, network, meet your fellow resistors <BR>
7:00 - 7:30 - Update since Oct meeting <BR>
7:30 - 8:30 - Guest speakers on environmental topics

We are allowed to bring food & drink, so please feel free to bring snacks, beer, wine, coffee, leftover halloween candy etc. 

I look forward to seeing everyone there!

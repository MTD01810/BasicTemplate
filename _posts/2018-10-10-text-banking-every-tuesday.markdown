* BYO smart phone or laptop

And once you are signed up and trained, you can text wherever and whenever you're available. 

**Why text bank?**
* You can do it from any device
* It's confidential - they don't get your number and you don't get theirs
* It's FAST! You can text hundreds of people in an hour.

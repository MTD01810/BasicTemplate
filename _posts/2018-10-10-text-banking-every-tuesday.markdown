Texting is the fastest way to get progressive voters to the polls! Join us for an hour of good company and texting. Training provided, coffee and snacks are optional.
* Monday evenings 6:30-7:30 pm
* Cafe Nero, 77 Main St. Andover
* BYO smart phone or laptop

And once you are signed up and trained, you can text wherever and whenever you're available. 

**Why text bank?**
* You can do it from any device
* It's confidential - they don't get your number and you don't get theirs
* It's FAST! You can text hundreds of people in an hour.

**Metrics**
* At our session on Tue Oct 9th 15 people converged and sent over 5,000 texts in one hour!

**Friend to friend texting** in swing districts via VoteWithMe
* This free app uses public voter files to tell us which of our phone contacts didn't vote in 2014 or 2016 and gives us an way to nudge them to vote in 2018.
* The app was used in the PA-18 to help Conor Lamb get elected, and in controlled trial found that it was 20x more effective than standard campaign tactics. Wow!

Any day you're booked solid (or maybe just exhausted) and therefore can't act, you can contribute to a worthy blue wave cause of your choice. Here are some ideas:

**Support Blue Wave Candidates**
* [Force Multiplier](https://www.forcemultiplierma.org/) - Instead of donating to individual campaigns, Force Multiplier identifies the critical races and voter empowerment efforts
where your donations can make the biggest difference in the 2020 election.

**Support Us - Greater Andover Indivisible**
* You can donate to our local chapter!
* Our activism continues to be entirely virtual, your donation support things like postage, printer toner, and other supplies. 
* Indivisible National is running a matching program from July 27 - Sept 20. For every dollar contributed, we will receive two dollars. Our goal is $750. 
* If you are able, [please contribute here:](https://bit.ly/2zH0N24)

**Other ways to resist with your wallet**<BR>
Any of the sister organizations listed throughout this site are worthy and in need of contributions. Some of our favorites are: 
* [ACLU](https://bit.ly/2TuvgI8) - American Civil Liberties Union

**Thank you for your generosity!**

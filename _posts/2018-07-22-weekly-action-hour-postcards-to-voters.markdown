Want to make a big impact in just one hour a week? Join us on Wednesdays where we will be writing postcards to Andover residents who are eligible to vote but are not yet registered. Please come help us drive local voter engagement and turnout for this fall's primary and mid-term election. 

* When: Wednesday evenings from 6:30-7:30 pm
* NEW DAY ADDED: Sunday afternoons from 3:00-4:00 pm
* Where: Panera Bread in North Andover

We will provide the postcards but please bring stamps. If you forget, we can supply them. 15 postcards costs $7, so please look for the donation jar. 

Everyone is welcome. Hope to see you there! #resist #persist

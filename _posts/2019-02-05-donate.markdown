Any day you're booked solid (or maybe just exhausted) and therefore can't ACT, you can contribute to a worthy blue wave cause of your choice. Here are some ideas:

**Indivisible Andover**
* You can donate to our local chapter!
* Your donation will support things like meeting room rentals, art supplies and transportation.
* [Support us here](https://bit.ly/2zH0N24)

**Other ways to resist with your wallet**<BR>
Any of the sister organizations listed throughout this site are worthy and in need of contributions. Some of our favorites are: 
* [ACLU](https://bit.ly/2TuvgI8) - American Civil Liberties Union
* [Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America](https://bit.ly/2j4poI3)
* Do you have an organization you would like to add to this list? Let us know!

**Find a campaign to support**
* [This list will be updated with 2019 special elections.]

**Thank you for your generosity!**

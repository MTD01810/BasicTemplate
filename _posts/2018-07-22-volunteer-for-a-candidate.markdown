In light of the global pandemic affecting everyone, everywhere, we are putting all in-person actions on hold until further notice. We are actively working to provide options that you can do from home with minimal or no contact with other people. Please see below for alternatives to actions we have previously provided. And if you have other ideas, please submit those to indivisible.andover@gmail.com. Thank you, and stay well. 

**Actions that will be changing**
* Postcards at Panera (Thursdays) - Postcards are available via packets you can pick up. For more information click [here](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/action/2019/02/04/weekly-action-hour-postcards-to-voters.html). 
* Text-banking at Caffe Nero (Tuesdays) - These will no longer be held in-person. We will communicate a way for those of you who are trained to access new workloads. 
* Visit an Elected Official - All of our elected officials have cancelled in-person office hours. Please feel free to call or email them with issues, their contact information is here. 

**Actions that can still be done safely**
* Donate
* Protest (Saturdays) - Bring Your Own Sign and we'll all stay far apart, but we'll continue to demonstrate.

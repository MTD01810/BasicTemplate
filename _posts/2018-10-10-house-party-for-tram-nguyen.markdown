Come meet our very own TRAM NGUYEN! Tram is the democratic candidate for State Representative from the 18th Essex district, and is looking to unseat one of the most conservative, narrow-minded members of the Massachusetts State Legislature. Tram is a smart, dynamic attorney who has devoted her career to serving working families, domestic violence survivors, seniors and veterans. Come meet Tram and find out how you can help her FLIP THIS SEAT BLUE! 

Rushna's address will be provided to those who RSVP.

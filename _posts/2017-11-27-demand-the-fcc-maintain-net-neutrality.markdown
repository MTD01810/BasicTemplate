The FCC has confirmed that they will vote on Dec 14 to abolish the regulations that prevent internet service providers from blocking access to certain sites, throttling internet speeds, and otherwise controlling what websites and online services are available to their customers.

The U.S. House of Representatives and the US Senate will not be involved in the upcoming vote to maintain net neutrality. Only five people at the FCC get to vote: Ajit Pai, Mignon Clyburn, Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, and Jessica Rosenworcel.

Both Mignon and Jessica plan to vote keep net neutrality. To defeat the net neutrality repeal, one of the other three needs to change their vote. Two of them are former Verizon executives.

Join Greater Andover Indivisible and other local organizations to fight Trump’s fake crisis and racist deportation force. Stand with us against the declaration of this unnecessary national emergency and abuse of power. The main threat our country is facing is not border crossings, but a dangerous assault on democracy. The president must respect Congress, the Constitution and the democratic process. Hope to see you there.

Please note: the protest is scheduled for 3:00 - 5:00 pm in order to demonstrate while there is still daylight. If there is a quorum of people who would like to protest at a different time, please feel free to turn up in this same location. It would be wonderful to have this run all day.

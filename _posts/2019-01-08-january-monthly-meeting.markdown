Please join us and help kick off 2019. 

First hour - Guest Speakers:
- Brian Major - The pros and cons of electronic voting for town meeting (instead of verbal ayes/nays, show of hands or standing)
- Shay Bradham - To discuss her book "Activism for Introverts" (books will be available for sale at the meeting)

Second hour - Action:
- Prioritize our focus for the year - members to provide input on where we will focus out energy so we can make the biggest impact.
- Postcards to unregistered voters between the ages of 18 and 25; there are 1,000 kids we could engage before the local election in March!

All are welcome - hope to see you there!

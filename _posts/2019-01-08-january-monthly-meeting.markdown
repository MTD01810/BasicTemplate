### Theme: The Environment and Climate Change

**Agenda**

On November 19, Greater Andover Indivisible (GAI) and [WECAN (Working to Educate for Climate Action Now)](https://www.massclimateaction.org/) will co-sponsor our chapter meeting to discuss strategies for tackling climate change at the national and local levels. 

Guest speakers will discuss: 
* Claire Teylouni and Nolan O’Brien from Senator Ed Markey’s office will give a presentation on the Green New Deal, the congressional resolution that lays out an ambitious plan for tackling climate change on a national level.
* Carol Oldham, Executive Director of the MA Climate Action Network (MCAN) will introduce us to a state program known as Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), and explain why CCA is one of the best ways for an entire community to cut its carbon emissions overnight.
* Michael Lindstrom, Andover’s Deputy Town Manager will discuss a plan in the works to bring CCA to Andover.
* GAI and WECAN representatives will offer some ways to support state and local efforts to address climate change and make us more sustainable.

Doors open at 6:30 for sign-in and socializing; the program begins promptly at 6:45 PM. Beverage, snack, dessert and monetary contributions are always appreciated.  

**Please join us - all are welcome!**

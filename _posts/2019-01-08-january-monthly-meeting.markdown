### Theme: Progressive Leadership
With a focus on building progressive leadership and transparency in the MA State House in 2020 and making our blue state a leader in progressive policies

**New Location!! Temple Emanuel 7 Haggetts Pond Road Andover, MA 01810**

**Agenda**

The Democratic majority in the Massachusetts State House has a profile that suggests potential for leadership on progressive issues. We as informed citizens and activists play a pivotal role in making that happen. At this meeting, learn how we can support the work of our elected leaders and be a voice in favor of progressive policies. It starts with understanding how our elected legislators actually vote and how we can collaborate to drive constructive change.

The presentation will include a refresher on the basic tools for establishing a positive working relationship with our elected officials and strategic insights on how and who to lobby to be most effective.

Guest speakers: 
* Erika Uyterhoeven and Matt Miller, co-founders of Act On Mass
* Jay Kaufman, 24-year representative from Middlesex-15th to the MA State House, now lead of Beacon Leadership Collaborative

Doors open at 6:30 for sign-in and socializing; the program begins promptly at 6:45 PM. Beverage, snack, dessert and monetary contributions are always appreciated.  

**Please join us - all are welcome!**

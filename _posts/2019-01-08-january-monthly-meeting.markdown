### Theme: Presidential Primary
Who's your top pick for President? Not sure? 

**New Location!! Temple Emanuel 7 Haggetts Pond Road Andover, MA 01810**

**Agenda**

Our February meeting will be focused on two topics: preparing everyone for the Mass Presidential primary which will take place on "Super Tuesday" March 3rd; and providing a report-out from our 2020 Strategy Meeting (see above). To help each of us decide on a Presidential candidate, we will be holding a caucus-like event. What does that mean? Read on or watch the video (link at bottom):
 
 - We will all gather in a room and align with the candidate we like most, or we can head to the "undecided" pool.
 - If a particular candidate has too little support (less than 15% of the people in the room), then those people are added to the pool.
 - At any time, any person in the room can make a case for their favorite candidate in order to persuade people to support their candidate.
 - We iterate until at least one candidate has 50% support, or we all decide to move to Canada.

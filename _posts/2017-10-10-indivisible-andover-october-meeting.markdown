We will be in the "Meeting Room" . Enter the building in the right of the courtyard through the door that says "Children's Center". We are up the stairs and to the right.

### Agenda
Since we are still in the early stages of our meeting cadence, it will still be largely introductory. We will set up sub-groups that will enable people to focus their energies on a cluster of issues. 

6:30 - 7:00 - Socialize, network, meet your fellow resistors <BR>
7:00 - 7:30 - Mission, progress, and plans (newsletter, etc.) <BR>
7:30 - 8:00 - Breakout groups <BR>
 - Winning in 2018 <BR>
 - Election Integrity <BR>
 - Social Justice <BR>
 - Public Health & Safety <BR>
 - Economic Justice <BR>

8:00 - 8:30 - Reconvene, action plans, optional war cry <BR>

We are allowed to bring food & drink, so please feel free to bring snacks, beer, wine, coffee, etc. 

I look forward to seeing everyone there!

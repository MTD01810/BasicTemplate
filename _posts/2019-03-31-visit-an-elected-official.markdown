Our federal congressmen hold Town Halls when they are not in DC, and our State congressmen hold Office Hours. Both are a great opportunity to introduce yourself, ask questions, and even raise specific concerns. 

Interested in helping to build an ongoing relationship with our Reps? We are joining forces with other Indivisible chapters in our congressional districts to forge a shared agenda and attend meetings together in order to be more impactful. For more information, please reach out:
* MA-03 Collaborative - working with Rep. Lori Trahan
* MA-06 Collaborative - working with Rep. Seth Moulton 

Ongoing dialog with our state level representatives:
* State Senator Barry Finegold
* State Rep Tram Nguyen
* State Rep Frank Moran
* State Rep Christina Minicucci

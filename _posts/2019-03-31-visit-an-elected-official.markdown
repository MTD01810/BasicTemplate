Our federal congressmen hold Town Halls when they are not in DC, and our State congressmen hold Office Hours. Meeting with elected officials is an important aspect of driving change - a great opportunity to introduce yourself, ask questions, and even raise specific concerns. There are multiple ways to engage with them:

**Visit a House Representative**<BR>
Massachusetts District 3 Rep. Lori Trahan in-district office hours:
* Lowell office (126 John St, Suite 12) - Mon-Fri 8:30-5:30
* Lawrence office (15 Union St, 4th floor) - Tue & Thu 8:00-Noon

Massachusetts District 6 Rep. Seth Moulton in-district office hours:
* Salem office (21 Front St) - (978) 531-1669

**Join a Collaborative**<BR>
Interested in helping to build an ongoing relationship with our Reps? We are joining forces with other Indivisible chapters in our congressional districts to forge a shared agenda and attend meetings together in order to be more impactful. For more information, please reach out:

Remember when more than fifty of us gathered in-person to share our goals and ambitions for the most consequential election year of our lives?  Seems like a lifetime ago, but our goals are still the same and the sense of urgency increases with each passing day. 

At our May meeting, we'll review your goals for Greater Andover Indivisible's 2020 Strategy and discuss the connections between them and action opportunities weâ€™ve identified to achieve our goals while maintaining social distancing.  

* **When**: Thursday May 7, 6:30-7:30 pm
* **Where**: Online

Note that this meeting is being held on Zoom during our usual Blue Power Hour time. To get the Zoom meeting link please RSVP using the blue button to the left. 

Hope you can join us!

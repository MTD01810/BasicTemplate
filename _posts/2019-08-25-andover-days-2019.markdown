Please join us Sunday Sept 22nd for the largest block party in the Merrimack Valley! Come for the food and music, stay for the peaceful revolution. Bring the kids, bring the dog, and help us spread the word about how important civic engagement is. 

**We are looking for volunteers to help us man the table.**

The event is from 10:00 am to 4:30 pm, so if you can make it please sign up using the [RSVP ](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/60b0b4ca4af2aa1f49-andover)button on the left. Volunteers will be thanked with a super on-trend **Indivisible t-shirt**.

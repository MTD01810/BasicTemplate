**NOTE: We think the likelihood of activation is high. We should all plan as though these events could be as early as 5pm local time on Wednesday, November 4. But, this is a tentative date & time.**

You will receive a notification and a message from the organizer when the final dates & times are final.

With every tweet and refusal to commit to accepting the legitimate results of the 2020 election, Trump seeks to stoke chaos and fear.

But we will be ready - if Trump tries to steal the election or prevent every vote from being counted, the Protect the Results will activate nationwide mobilizations to demand that all the votes are counted and for the peaceful transition of power.

Join us to honor the valid results of the 2020 election, ensure that every vote is counted, and show up to demand the peaceful transition of power.

### Theme: Building the 2020 Blue Wave
How to defeat Trump, flip the Senate and turn our country blue

**Agenda**

From now until the election in November, we will be holding action-packed events instead of our typical chapter meetings. Specific plans will vary from session to session, but we will always have texting and post-carding stations. Other options may include letter writing, phone-banking, and voter registration. This is a drop-in event so come for an hour or stay for two. Bring a friend or a group of friends. 

* When: Sunday March 1 2:00-4:00 pm
* Where: Temple Emanuel, 7 Haggetts Pond Road, Andover 01810

Beverage, snack, dessert and monetary contributions are always appreciated.Â  

**Please join us - all are welcome!**

Our focus this year will be on getting as many Dems elected as possible - at the local, state, and federal levels; on our home turf and in sister districts all over the country. 

**Guest Speakers**
* [Josh Zakim](https://www.joshzakim.com/) - Candidate for MA Secretary of State
* [Dan Koh](https://koh2018.com/) - Candidate for Congress MA-03 
* Sherri Riesner - Will speak about money in politics and efforts underway to repeal Citizens United. Sherri is a member of [Represent.Us](https://represent.us/) and [American Promise](http://www.americanpromise.net/).

[Represent.Us](https://represent.us/) works nationally and is based in Massachusetts. Represent.Us has a broad democracy-movement agenda that includes reforming lobbying legislation, campaign finance, and electoral processes to strengthen representative democracy so that our government truly does…represent us!  Massachusetts is not a target state for a Represent.Us-driven legislative action at this time. However, volunteer chapters have been busy working with partner organizations on ballot initiatives, educating the public, and passing state bills related to campaign finance and electoral reforms. Last spring, the 2 state chapters led an effort to pass 25 non-binding anti-corruption resolutions in town meetings across the state. These resolutions call on our state legislators to to work for reforms that will strengthen democracy. Several towns are working to pass additional resolutions this year. 

[American Promise](http://www.americanpromise.net/) is focused solely on an amendment to the US Constitution to overturn the Citizens United v. FEC Supreme Court ruling.  The group is currently running a Mass ballot initiative called People Govern, Not Money. If successful, it will create a 15-person citizens' commission to keep our legislators’ feet to the fire regarding efforts to overturn Citizens United. The state legislature passed a resolution in 2012 asking Congress to propose an amendment for the states to ratify (Currently, there are 8 amendment proposals in the U.S. Congress.), but that resolution has collected dust. We’d like to see Mass become a leader in this effort and the commission would be a big step in that direction. Last fall we gathered 90,000 verified voter signatures in favor of the ballot initiative (67,000 were required.). This May we begin part 2 of the effort, gathering another 20,000 signatures to clear 10,600 verified signatures. If you’d like to help with that, you can go to [peoplegovernnotmoney.org](http://peoplegovernnotmoney.org) and click on the volunteer tab to connect with people in your area.

**No Women's March in Boston this year? No problem!**

Join us for a Women's Rally in Andover as we gather in solidarity with millions across the country to mark the THIRD anniversary of the momentous 2017 Women's March.

All activists are welcome, and please bring your signs about the issues we all care about: climate change, peace, immigration, gun control, healthcare, impeachment, and the 2020 election. Homemade hot pink hats are optional (but encouraged).

* **When**: Saturday January 18th from 10:00am-12:30pm
* **Where**: Shawsheen Square (14 York St for your GPS)

Please bring friends, family and even dogs.

And please RSVP so we know approximately how many people will be attending.

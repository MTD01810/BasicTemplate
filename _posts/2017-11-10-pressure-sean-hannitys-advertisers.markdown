Sean Hannity is functioning as a propagandist in order to advance a political agenda in support of Donald Trump. To this end, he peddles disinformation and aggressively promotes discredited conspiracies.

Given the intensity of his promotion of Trump’s political interests as well as his reported clandestine collaborations, companies that sponsor Hannity’s show are essentially supporting financially a partisan operation. 21st Century Fox (Fox News’ parent company) has yet to hold Hannity accountable for his extremism, deceit, and reckless conspiracy peddling.

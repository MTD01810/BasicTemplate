Come meet one of the candidates for Massachusetts's Third Congressional District: Dan Koh. He will be here to meet constituents, discuss concerns, and mingle. Please feel free to invite groups from other towns in the district.

In addition, there will be a pollster joining us for the latter part of the program to discuss taking back progressive control of congress and beyond - the history, the tactics, and the challenges we will face.

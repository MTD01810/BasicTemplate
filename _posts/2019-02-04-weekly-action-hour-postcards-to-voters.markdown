### Postcarding via Packages To-Go!

Donâ€™t let COVID-19 dampen your Democratic spirit! While we manage the challenges of avoiding group events, we offer postcard packages to-go. Postcard writing has been very popular with Greater Andover Indivisible members, who find it very gratifying.
<BR><BR><BR>
**How To Get Started**
* Postcard packets are available on the front porch of **26 Cutler Rd, Andover, MA**. Feel free to stop by any time.
* Our packages include postcards, addresses, stamps and instructions. Contributions of $5 per 10-card packet to help cover printing and postage costs are welcomed. 
* Please feel free to pick up multiple packs if you're feeling productive or recruiting others to help. Bulk packs (of 125 or 250 cards) are also available.
* Stay in the loop on postcarding news by [signing up for our newsletter](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/become-a-member.html).


**Upcoming Postcard Campaigns** <BR>
Available postcarding campaigns vary from week to week, and may include cards provided by [Postcards to Voters](http://Postcardstovoters.org), [SwingLeft](https://swingleft.org/) or [Reclaim Our Vote](http://centerforcommonground.org/main/index.php/campaigns/reclaim-our-vote) which will include:

* Postcards for **Reclaim our Vote** target voters of color to make sure their votes get counted in Southern states where voter suppression tactics are most aggressive. 

* With **Postcards to Voters** we send reminders to targeted voters, giving Democrats a winning edge in key districts across the U.S.

* **Swing Left** postcards encourage Vote By Mail balloting (VBM), which also helps drive higher Democratic turnout.

* Other impactful campaigns may be offered from time to time.

### Thank you to all who are mobilizing their friends, neighbors and family members, we are welcoming several new postcard writers every week.  As of mid-August, we have sent out almost 23,000 postcards this year! Wow!!

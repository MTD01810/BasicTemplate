### Postcarding via Packages To-Go!

Don't let COVID-19 dampen your Democratic spirit! While we manage the challenges of avoiding group events, we will offer postcard packages to-go. Postcard packets are now available on the front porch of (26 Cutler Rd, Andover). Feel free to stop by any time. 

Our packages include postcards, addresses, stamps and instructions. Contributions of $5-10 to help cover costs and postage are welcomed.

**Upcoming Postcard Campaigns** <BR>
For the next several weeks, we’ll be offering postcarding campaigns provided by [Postcards to Voters](http://Postcardstovoters.org), [SwingLeft](https://swingleft.org/) or Reclaim Our Vote which will include: 

* Postcard packages for Reclaim our Vote notify voters of color in several southern states that they've been removed from the voter rolls and encourage them to re-register

* Reminders to targeted voters to give Democrats a winning edge in Special Election races in key districts across the U.S.

* Reminders to targeted Florida residents to enroll for Vote By Mail balloting (VBM). Having more Democrats enrolled in FLORIDA’S VOTE BY MAIL “no excuses required” program will lead to more Democratic candidate wins.

* Other impactful voter registration drives as these become available.

### Thanks you to all who are mobilizing their friends, neighbors and family members, we are welcoming several new postcard writers every week.  And we have sent out almost 15,000 postcards this year!

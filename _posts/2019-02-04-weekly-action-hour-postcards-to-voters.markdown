**Why postcard?**
* It's surprisingly effective - the key is the personalization
* It's social! If you do it in groups, but 
* You can do it anywhere

**Postcard with us** <BR>
Want to make a big impact in just one hour a week? Join us on Wednesdays where we write postcards to voters in the community and in swing districts all over the country.
* When: Wednesday evenings from 6:30-7:30 pm
* Where: Panera Bread in North Andover
* What to bring: We provide the postcards but please bring stamps or $7 for the postage. 

**Upcoming Campaigns** <BR>
For the next several weeks, we'll be offering two postcarding campaigns. Join us to write cards for one of the following:

1. Postcarding to support [BRENT FINNEGAN](https://www.brentfinnegan.com/cms/meet-brent/), who is running for the House of Delegates in VA District 26. All state seats in Virginia are up for election on Nov. 5. Currently the state senate is split 21R/19D and the House of Delegates is split 51R/49D. With some work, we have a very real opportunity to gain a Democratic majority in the Virginia state government. Brent Finnegan is a strong progressive candidate who lost his last election by 1800 votes. With his experience and name recognition he has a good chance of winning this fall. 

2. Postcarding for [The ROE Act](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-advocacy-fund-massachusetts-inc/issues/roe-act). Greater Andover Indivisible recently joined the ROE Act Coalition which is comprised of the NARAL, ACLU, and Planned Parenthood organizations in MA. To augment the Coalition's efforts, several Indivisible and allied groups have collaborated with us to create a “postcards to voters” campaign that has been blessed by the Coalition and paid for by the participating groups.

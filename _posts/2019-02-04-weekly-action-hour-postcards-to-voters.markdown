**Why postcard?**
* It's surprisingly effective - the key is the personalization
* It's social! If you do it in groups, but 
* You can do it anywhere

**Postcard with us** <BR>
Want to make a big impact in just one hour a week? Join us on Wednesdays where we write postcards to voters in the community and in swing districts all over the country.
* When: Wednesday evenings from 6:30-7:30 pm
* Where: Panera Bread in North Andover
* What to bring: We provide the postcards and address but when possible, please bring stamps or $5 for the postage. 

**Upcoming Campaigns** <BR>
For the next several weeks, weâ€™ll be offering postcarding campaigns provided by [Postcards to Voters](http://Postcardstovoters.org) which will include: 

1. Reminders to targeted voters to give Democrats a winning edge in Special Election races in key districts across the U.S. 

2. Reminders to targeted Florida residents to enroll for Vote By Mail balloting. Having more Democrats enrolled in FLORIDA'S VOTE BY MAIL "no excuses required" program will lead to more Democratic candidate wins. Why? Because voters enrolled in VBM cast ballots at a significantly stronger rate than those who vote in person.

### Come Write Postcards to Help Save our Democracy
* When: Thursday evenings from 6:30-7:30 pm

* What to bring: We provide the postcards and addresses but when possible, please bring stamps or $5 for the postage. 

**Postcard with Greater Andover Indivisible** <BR>
Want to make a big impact with like-minded folks just one hour a week? Join us on Thursdays as we write postcards to voters in the community and in swing districts all over the country.

We provide the postcards, markers, addresses and stamps. Contributions of $5 to help cover postage are welcomed, but not required.

**Upcoming Campaigns** <BR>
For the next several weeks, we’ll be offering postcarding campaigns provided by [Postcards to Voters](http://Postcardstovoters.org) or [SwingLeft](https://swingleft.org/) which will include: 

1. Reminders to targeted voters to give Democrats a winning edge in Special Election races in key districts across the U.S.

2. Reminders to targeted Florida residents to enroll for Vote By Mail balloting (VBM). Having more Democrats enrolled in FLORIDA’S VOTE BY MAIL “no excuses required” program will lead to more Democratic candidate wins. Why? Because voters enrolled in VBM cast ballots at a significantly stronger rate than those who vote in person.

3. Other impactful voter registration drives as these become available.

Please join us!

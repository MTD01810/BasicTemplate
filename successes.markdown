**Details on our [2019 Mission](../issues/2019-mission-and-resources.html)**

Thanks to everyone who participated in our March meeting where we kicked off our Working Groups. The group topics were chosen based on the results of our 2019 prioritization survey. These teams will enable us to go on the offense in a number of fronts and ensure our elected officials at all levels are making progress on our progressive agenda. 

It's not too late to join. If you would like to get started with any of the groups below or just learn more, please get in touch with us.

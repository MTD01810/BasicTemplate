### Mission Statement <BR>
Our mission is to mobilize the electorate, through progressive grassroots activism, to achieve true representative democracy that advances our country’s commitment to protect and serve all members of society.

**Our Chapter** <BR>
Greater Andover Indivisible (GAI) is a grassroots all-volunteer, non-profit organization working toward building a progressive future.  Since its founding in 2017, GAI has grown to over 500 members, including Massachusetts residents from Andover, North Andover, North Reading, Tewksbury and Wilmington.  GAI has played a key role in local Andover elections and the 2018 midterms elections.  GAI remains committed to providing its members – many of whom are new to political activism – with the insights, tools, and opportunities to affect change both locally and nationally.<BR>

GAI is a chapter of The Indivisible Project, a national grassroots organization that advocates for progressive political policies and leadership.  GAI is one of 150 MA chapters and 6,000 across the country. <BR>

GAI is not affiliated with any political party although we typically support progressive candidates, leaders, and issues.

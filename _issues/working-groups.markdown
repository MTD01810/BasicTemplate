Thanks to everyone who participated in our March meeting where we kicked off our Working Groups. The topics were chosen based on the results of our 2019 prioritization survey. These teams will enable us to go on the offense in a number of fronts and to ensure our elected officials at all levels are making progress on our progressive agenda.  

It's not too late to join. If you would like to get started with any of the groups below or just learn more, please contact us.

* [Progressive Leadership ](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/successes/progressive-leadership.html)
* [Environment ](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/successes/environment.html)
* [Healthcare](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/successes/healthcare.html) 
* [Civic Engagement ](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/successes/civic-engagement.html)
* [Election Integrity](http://indivisibleandoverma.com/successes/election-integrity.html) 

What's entailed? Each working group can determine how they communicate, how often, and what their focus is going to be. The goal is to have five teams of people who understand each topic at a detailed level, with the power of the chapter behind them if and when action is necessary. It should not entail more work from any individual person, but the efforts will make the chapter much more effective.

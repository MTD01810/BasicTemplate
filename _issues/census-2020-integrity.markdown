**Why does the US Census integrity matter? **
The year 2020 Census, currently under way, is the 23rd decennial Census of the United States of America. The most immediately important political consequence of the census will be the apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives' 435 congressional districts for the 2002 elections. A state that had 5/435ths of the nation's population in 1990 currently sends five representatives to the U.S. House. If it still has the same proportion of the U.S. population within its borders in 2020, it will keep its five representatives. The populations of each state, however, do no grow at the same rate. Consequently, some states' shares of the nation's population will have declined over the past ten years. Those states will lose House members while states that have seen their populations grow relatively faster will gain seats. Once the census numbers are collected and certified, they will be passed to the legislatures of each state for the purpose of drawing new congressional districts.

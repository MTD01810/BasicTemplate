Another enormous focus of the Indivisible movement is to improve the integrity of elections going forward. This includes efforts against: 
* Gerrymandering
* Campaign finance reform, transparency of donors
* Voter suppression
* Automatic voter registration
* Paper ballot backups
* Ensuring an informed public by defending a free press and mitigating fake news

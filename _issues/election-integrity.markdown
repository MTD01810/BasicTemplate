Another enormous focus of the Indivisible movement is to improve the integrity of elections going forward. This includes efforts against: 
* Gerrymandering
* Campaign finance reform, transparency of donors
* Voter suppression
* Automatic voter registration
* Paper ballot backups
* Ensuring an informed public by defending a free press and mitigating fake news

Some of the organizations we collaborate with on this front are:
* [League of Women Voters](http://lwv.org/)
* [Let People Vote](https://www.aclu.org/other/let-people-vote-removing-restrictions-and-barriers-voting-america)
* [Mass Vote](http://massvote.org/)

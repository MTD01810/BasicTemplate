**Why canvass?**
* It's the most effective way to reach voters
* It's an easy ask - you don't have to change minds
* Targeting intermittent voters is complementary to the super voters typically targeted by campaigns

Canvassing opportunities:
1. [EVP canvassing with Indivisible Andover](https://bit.ly/2LPgjfV)
* Training every Saturday, or on request
* Once you're trained and you have your EVP turf, you can canvass whenever you want. 

2. Volunteer for the [Coordinated Campaign](https://act.myngp.com/Forms/-5510369440999142400) to support Dems running for MA seats up and down the ticket

3. For any of the three ballot questions

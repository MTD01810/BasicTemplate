The Conor Lamb PA-18 race isn't finalized yet, but as of now Lamb is ahead by ~600 votes. Why this race is important:

**The race itself**
* The reason this special election was necessary was because a vocal anti-choice GOP Congressman pressured his mistress to have an abortion. He was forced to step down. ([Details](http://politi.co/2DrV0Ml) Politico 4 Oct 2017)
* The GOP opponent's proud tagline was "I was Trump before Trump was Trump", embracing all of his hate and ignorance. ([Details](http://wapo.st/2GsVYv1) WaPo 14 Mar 2018)
* The GOP spent $20M and sent 5 high-level Republicans to stump for Saccone, including the President. Whether the voters were repulsed by the GOP or drawn towards a positive Dem message is being debated on the news, but I would argue it's much more the latter. I think people want leadership with integrity. ([Details](http://nyti.ms/2pbMexB) NYT 14 Mar 2018)
* Conor Lamb is the first Dem to even dare to run in this district in years. He's a young, good looking former Marine. In order to win the game you have to play - we need a 50 state, down-ballot strategy. 
* Pundits have been saying all along that "even if Lamb loses a close one, this is a success". I don't believe in symbolic victories, we need the bastards out of office. We need to win, not threaten to win.

**Looking forward**
* Trump won this district by 20 points.
* There are 119 GOP held House seats that were won by a margin of less than 20 points. ([Details](http://nym.ag/2InbIQN) NY Mag 13 Mar 2018) 
* We only need to flip 24 in November to take back the House. We need candidates and plans everywhere. ([Details](https://swingleft.org/about) Swing Left)
* Conor Lamb is no liberal. He never said anything anti-Trump, but did say he does not recognize Nancy Pelosi as the party leader in the House. So while this is a victory on paper, accountability will be a big part of ensuring that this flipped seat parlays in to sound policy. ([Details](http://cnn.it/2FHf5QE) CNN 13 Mar 2018)
* There was a 3rd party candidate in this very close race who received a not-insignificant number of votes. We need to push for stacked rank voting so that these 3rd party candidates (who can and should run) do not result in voters' second choice ending up in office.

**But for now - This is a victory and should be celebrated.**

**Why text bank?**
* You can do it from any device
* It's confidential - they don't get your number and you don't get theirs
* It's FAST! You can text 1,000 people in an hour.

* This free app uses public voter files to tell us which of our phone contacts didn't vote in 2014 or 2016 and gives us an way to nudge them to vote in 2018. 
* The app was used in the PA-18 to help Conor Lamb get elected, and in controlled trial found that it was 20x more effective than standard campaign tactics. Wow!

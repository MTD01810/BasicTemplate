All five of the candidates we supported in this year's off-cycle local election won:
* Annie Gilbert and Chris Huntress for Selectboard
* Tracey Spruce and Susan McCready for School Committee
* Sheila Doherty for Moderator

**GOTV Effort**
Healthy turnout for an off-cycle local race for Andover was expected to be around 15-16%. This race was 19.8%. That's a 4% bump in turnout, about 1,000 additional voters.

Thank you to everyone who volunteered for the campaigns, helped with our GOTV postcards, and voted today - every little bit matters.

Any day you're booked solid (or maybe just exhausted) and therefore can't ACT, you can contribute $5 to a worthy blue wave cause of your choice. Here are some ideas:

**Indivisible Andover**
* You can donate to our local chapter!
* Your donation will support things like meeting room rentals, art supplies and transportation.
* [Support us here](https://bit.ly/2zH0N24)

**Susan Collins's future opponent**
* If Susan Collins votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, this crowd-funded money will be donated to whomever decides to run against her (when she is up for reelection in 2020). 
* (The fund has reached $1.7M already ... )
* [Hold Susan Collins accountable](https://bit.ly/2NbuPiK)

**RAINN** - Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network
* Based on Dr. Ford's testimony during the Kavanaugh hearings from last week, you can donate to RAINN, the largest sexual assault support organization in the US.
* [Support RAINN](https://donate.rainn.org/)

**Are we missing any worthy organizations in need of support? Let us know.**

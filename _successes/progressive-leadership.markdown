The Progressive Leadership working group is focused on getting progressive candidates elected at all levels of government. However, an election victory is not the ultimate goal - once in office we collaborate with elected officials to ensure meaningful policies are passed and precedents are defended in accordance with our overall agenda. 

**Specific Efforts**
* Federal seats – Senate, House
* State seats – State Officers, State Senate, State House
* Local Boards and Committees
* Judges
* Home turf and out-of-district
* Particular work towards a more representative government, meaning support for candidates from underrepresented demographics: women, blacks, latinax, veterans, etc. 

**Upcoming Races**
* Local Town Elections - Spring 2020
* Special and off-year Elections - 2019 and 2020
* Prep for 2020 - Presidential, Senate, House and state elections

**Activism**
* Attend meet the candidates events, debates
* Relay opportunities for members to support a specific campaign – canvass, post-carding, text banking, phone banking, sign holding, letters to the editor, donate $
* Relay opportunities for members to help out-of-district/state efforts
* Voter registration
* Lobbying at State House and Town Halls with Congressional Representatives

The Progressive Leadership working group is focused on getting progressive candidates elected at all levels of government. However, an election victory is not the ultimate goal - once in office we collaborate with elected officials to ensure meaningful policies are passed and precedents are defended in accordance with our overall agenda. 

**Specific Efforts**
* Federal seats – Senate, House
* State seats – State Officers, State Senate, State House
* Local Boards and Committees
* Judges
* Home turf and out-of-district
* Particular work towards a more representative government, meaning support for candidates from underrepresented demographics: women, blacks, latinax, veterans, etc. 

**Upcoming Races**
* Andover Local Election - March 2019
* Special elections (leftover from the midterms, e.g. NC)
* Prep for 2020 - Presidential, Senate, House

**Activism**
* Attend Meet the Candidates events, debates
* Support a specific campaign – Canvass, Post-carding, Text banking, Phone banking, Sign holding, Letters to the Editor, Donate $
* Candidate vetting criteria, endorsements
* Prioritizing out-of-district efforts

**Groups to Collaborate With**
* Swing Left
* Sister District
* Brand New Congress
* Flippable
* Our Revolution (MA), Flip Massachusetts
* Minuteman Indivisible (Lexington), Progressive MA
* ADTC, Mass Dems
